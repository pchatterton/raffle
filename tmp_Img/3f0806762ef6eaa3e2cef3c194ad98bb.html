    <td height="158" align="right"><p>The <strong>American black bear</strong> (<em><strong>Ursus americanus</strong></em>) is North America's smallest   and most common species of bear. It is a   generalist animal, being able to exploit numerous different habitats and   foodstuffs. The American black bear is listed by the IUCN as Least Concern, due to the species' widespread   distribution and a large global population estimated to be twice that of all   other bear species combined. The species is   not overly dangerous to humans, but has been responsible for a few deaths, as   well as property damage and livestock predation.</p>
